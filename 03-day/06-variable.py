"""
Comments are an extremely useful feature in most programming languages. Everything you’ve written in your programs so far is Python code.
As your programs become longer and more complicated, you should add
notes within your programs that describe your overall approach to the
problem you’re solving. A comment allows you to write notes in English
within your programs.

In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following a
hash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter. For example: this whole section is a multiple comment

# Say hello to everyone.
print("Hello Python people!")
